<center><h1> Welcome to my first page</h1> <center
<center> My name is Angel.</center>
<h2> Information about me </h2>

<p> I am very lucky to hava a wonderful and supporting family that does all they can to support me in all I do. <br>
    I have to admit to some silly jealousy.  Two years ago I got my husband a Harley and when the weather is <br>
    nice he goes out with the bike and I have to wait for my turn. LOL<br> <img src="Minions2.jpg" alt="laughing"><br>
    I have been working in food safety for over ten years and still enjoy it to this day. The best part of my <br>
    job is knowing that what I do keeps food safe. As much as I travel though there is no way I could do it without him.</p>
<p> I would really like for some time to have hobbies.  Between my job and school I don't have time for much of <br> 
    anything else.  Selfcare is very important and should be done by everyone. My hope is that after graduation <br>
  I will have time to read again and work on crochet since I find it relaxing.</p>
<h3> Angel's most visted websites</h3>
<p> I do most of the grocery shopping for my family. So I always visit Dillions. </p>
<li><a href="https://www.dillons.com">Dillions</a></li>
<p> For work I am constantly on the Fisher Scientific website to price and order supplies </p>
<li><a href="https://www.fishersci.com/us/en/home.html">Fisher Scientific</a></li>
<p> On the off chance that I do have some time for myself I enjoy Nancy Drew games for my computer.</p>
