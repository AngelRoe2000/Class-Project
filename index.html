<h1> Welcome to my first page  </h>

<h2> Information about me </h2>
<p> My name is Angel.</p>
<p> I have been working in food safety for over ten years
  and still enjoy it to this day. The best part of my job is
  knowing that what I do keeps food safe.</p>
<p> I would really like for some time to have hobbies.  Between 
  my job and school I don't have time for much of anything else.  
  Selfcare is very important and should be done by everyone. My
  hope is that after graduation I will have time to read again and
  work on crochet since I find it relaxing.
<h3> Angel's most visted websites</h3>
<p> I do most of the grocery shopping for my family. So I always visit Dillions. </p>

<p> For work I am constantly on the Fisher Scientific website to price and order supplies </p>

<p> On the off chance that I do have some time for myself I enjoy Nancy Drew games for my computer.
